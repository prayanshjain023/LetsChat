# Letschat
Let's Chat is a real-time live chat app built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js with Vite, Node.js). It uses Redux Toolkit for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and socket.io for real-time chat. React Icons and other UI/UX enhancements improve the user experience.
